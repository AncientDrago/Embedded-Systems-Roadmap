# Example Projects — ATxmega128A1U

This folder contains complete, ready-to-run example programs that combine multiple concepts from earlier modules.

## 📌 What You Will Learn
- Integrating GPIO + Timers + Interrupts
- Debugging embedded code structure
- Building modular drivers
- Writing clean and reusable firmware

## 📁 Folder Contains
Example project ideas (you will add code later):
- **Blink + Interrupt button**
- **PWM LED fade**
- **ADC read + UART print**
- **SPI OLED display demo**
- **I²C temperature sensor logger**
- **DAC waveform generator**
- **Multi-module integration demo**

Each project will include:
- `main.c`
- Driver files (if required)
- Short explanation of logic
- Wiring diagram (optional)

## 🚀 Next Steps
You will use these examples as templates to build more advanced firmware projects and demonstrate hands-on microcontroller skills to companies like NVIDIA, Qualcomm, TI, and DRDO labs.
