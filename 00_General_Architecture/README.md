# 1️⃣ General MCU Architecture — Fundamentals

This module introduces the internal architecture of a microcontroller with clear explanations and simple diagrams.  
You will understand how every subsystem works and how firmware interacts with the hardware.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand what happens inside an MCU.
- Visualize how CPU, memory, and peripherals are connected.
- Read block diagrams from datasheets.
- Identify buses, registers, and memory maps.
- Relate architecture to embedded C code.
