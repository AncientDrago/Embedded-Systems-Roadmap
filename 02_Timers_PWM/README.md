# Timers & Counters — ATxmega128A1U

This module explains how to configure and use the powerful 16-bit timers on the ATxmega128A1U.

## 📌 What You Will Learn
- Timer basic setup (TC0 / TC1)
- Clock sources & prescalers
- Compare match interrupts
- Overflow interrupts
- Generating periodic events
- Delay generation (non-blocking)
- Introduction to event system

## 📁 Folder Contains
- `main.c` → timer examples (to be added)
- Notes on timer registers and wave generation modes
- Exercises such as:
  - Generate a 1ms system tick  
  - Build a millisecond timer  
  - Implement software PWM  

## 🛠 Hardware Used
- ATxmega128A1U board  
- Logic analyzer or oscilloscope (optional)

## 🚀 Next Steps
After this module:
- You will configure PWM for motor/LED control  
- Then move to serial peripherals (SPI, I2C, USART)
