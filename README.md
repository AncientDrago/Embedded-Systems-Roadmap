# Embedded Systems Roadmap: Bare-Metal → STM32 → RTOS

This repository documents a complete learning path for becoming an industry-ready **Embedded Systems Engineer**, starting from low-level **bare-metal programming on ATxmega128A1U** to **ARM Cortex-M (STM32)** and **RTOS fundamentals**.

These modules reflect the same embedded concepts I utilize during my work at **DRDO–NSTL**, particularly in real-time firmware design, sensor drivers, and hardware–software integration.

## 🚀 Why This Repository Exists

Most embedded tutorials use libraries and skip fundamentals.

This repo builds the core engineering intuition required for roles in **Robotics, Automotive, Defence, and real-time embedded systems**:

- Register-level programming  
- Timing determinism  
- Interrupt architecture  
- Peripheral driver development  
- Communication protocols  
- Hardware debugging  
- RTOS design thinking

## 📘 Learning Path Overview

### 1️⃣ ATxmega128A1U — Bare-Metal Foundations

Learn real embedded engineering:

- GPIO + Ports  
- Timers, Counters, ISRs  
- ADC + Filtering  
- USART, SPI, I2C drivers (no HAL)  
- PWM + Motor control  
- Real-time event handling  
- IMU interfacing  

---

### 2️⃣ STM32 (Cortex-M) — Industry MCU

Move to modern ARM architecture:

- HAL / LL / Register-level access  
- EXTI & High-speed peripherals  
- DMA-driven data pipelines  
- IMU/MEMS drivers  
- FreeRTOS basics  
- Debugging with SWD, Logic analyzers, Oscilloscopes  

---

### 3️⃣ RTOS Essentials

Practical real-time system building:

- Tasks, Queues, Semaphores  
- ISRs inside RTOS  
- Time Slicing vs Preemption  
- Designing deterministic loops  
- Embedded architecture patterns
