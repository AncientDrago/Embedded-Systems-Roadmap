# ATxmega128A1U Embedded Systems Learning Repository

A structured, industry-focused collection of firmware modules and example projects for the ATxmega128A1U.  
Designed to build strong low-level embedded fundamentals and create a smooth transition toward STM32, ARM Cortex-M, and professional embedded engineering roles.

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a deep understanding of **register-level firmware development**  
- Learn embedded design without relying on vendor libraries  
- Understand peripheral modules at a professional level  
- Prepare for roles in **defence, robotics, automotive, embedded systems, silicon design companies**  
- Form a strong base for moving into **STM32, FreeRTOS, and ARM Cortex-M development**

---

## 🔧 Hardware Requirements

- ATxmega128A1U development board  
- USB-UART interface (FT232/CH340)  
- Basic sensors (I²C/SPI/Analog)  
- LEDs, buttons, jumpers, breadboard 
- Logic analyzer or oscilloscope (optional but recommended)

---

## 📌 Module Progress

All modules contain:  
- A dedicated README  
- Register explanations  
- Exercises  
- Example programs (`main.c` to be added progressively)

More code will be added regularly, with a clear commit history to show learning progression and driver development.
