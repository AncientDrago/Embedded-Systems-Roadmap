# ADC — Analog to Digital Converter (ATxmega128A1U)

This module focuses on reading analog signals using the XMEGA’s high-speed, 12-bit ADC.

## 📌 What You Will Learn
- ADC basics (resolution, sampling, reference, channels)
- Single-ended vs differential mode
- Configuring ADC clock & prescalers
- Using internal references (1V, 2.5V)
- Reading analog values from sensors
- Interrupt-based ADC sampling
- Oversampling & filtering techniques

## 📁 Folder Contains
- `main.c` → sample code for ADC reads (to be added)
- Notes on ADC configuration registers
- Exercises:
  - Read a potentiometer and map values  
  - Build a simple voltmeter  
  - Implement moving-average filtering  

## 🛠 Hardware Used
- ATxmega128A1U board
- Potentiometer or analog sensors (LDR, temperature sensor)

## 🚀 Next Steps
With ADC mastered, you can move to:
- Sensor fusion  
- Closed-loop control systems  
- Signal filtering with timers + ADC
