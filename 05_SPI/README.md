# SPI — Serial Peripheral Interface (ATxmega128A1U)

This module explains how to use SPI for high-speed communication with sensors, displays, memory chips, and other microcontrollers.

## 📌 What You Will Learn
- SPI basics (MOSI, MISO, SCK, SS)
- Master/Slave configuration
- Clock polarity (CPOL) and phase (CPHA)
- SPI speed selection
- Sending & receiving bytes
- Chip select (manual vs hardware)
- Debugging SPI with logic analyzers

## 📁 Folder Contains
- `main.c` → SPI master example (to be added)
- Notes on SPI control registers
- Exercises:
  - Interface an SPI sensor  
  - Control an SPI OLED display  
  - Communicate between two ATxmegas  

## 🛠 Hardware Used
- ATxmega128A1U board
- SPI device (OLED, EEPROM, or sensor)

## 🚀 Next Steps
After learning SPI:
- I2C becomes easy  
- You can build full driver stacks
