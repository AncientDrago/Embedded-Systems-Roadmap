# Interrupts — ATxmega128A1U

This module introduces how to use interrupts for responsive and non-blocking embedded applications.

## 📌 What You Will Learn
- Global interrupt enable/disable
- Configuring pin-change interrupts
- Configuring timer interrupts (TC0, TC1)
- ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) structure
- Interrupt priorities on XMEGA
- Edge detection (rising / falling)
- Debouncing using interrupts

## 📁 Folder Contains
- `main.c` → example interrupt-driven LED/button program (to be added)
- Notes on interrupt vectors and flags
- Exercises to build reaction-time systems and event counters

## 🛠 Hardware Used
- ATxmega128A1U board  
- LEDs and push buttons

## 🚀 Next Steps
Once interrupts are understood:
- You will use timers for PWM and scheduling  
- You will combine interrupts with SPI/I2C communication
